# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Must Know

For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. Here is a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful

### Concepts Needed:

1. Dynamic Programming: [Dynamic Progrmming GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)
2. Prime Factorization: [Prime Factorization Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-factors-multiples/pre-algebra-prime-factorization-prealg/v/prime-factorization)
