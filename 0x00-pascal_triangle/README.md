# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

## What is Pascal's Triangle?

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known in China and Persia several centuries before Pascal's time. It is a triangular array of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it, forming a triangular pattern. The rows of Pascal's Triangle represent the coefficients of the binomial expansion. The first row contains a single number 1, the second row contains two numbers 1 and 1, and each subsequent row is constructed by adding the adjacent numbers from the row above.


## What are Python Algorithms?

Python algorithms refer to sequences of computational steps that are followed to solve a problem or perform a task using the Python programming language. These algorithms can range from simple procedures, such as sorting a list of numbers, to complex operations, like optimizing routes in a transportation network. Python's versatility and readability make it a popular choice for implementing various algorithms in fields such as data science, machine learning, cryptography, and more.

When working with Python algorithms, it's essential to understand fundamental concepts such as data structures, recursion, iteration, and algorithmic complexity. By mastering these concepts and applying them effectively, developers can write efficient and reliable algorithms to tackle diverse computational challenges.
