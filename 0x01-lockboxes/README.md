# 0x01. Lockboxes

The Lockbox algorithm is a cryptographic method used for secure communication between two parties over an insecure channel. It's a type of public-key encryption scheme designed for secure key exchange.

## Must Know

For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this projec.
